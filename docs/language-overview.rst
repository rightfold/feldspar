Language Overview
=================

Feldspar is a programming language featuring simple syntax, referential
transparency, type inference, and a small efficient implementation. It can be
compared with Python in terms of scope, and with Haskell in terms of
programming style.

The source code of the Feldspar implementation is freely available under the
BSD 3-Clause license. The Feldspar compiler and interpreter are written in
Rust, making it suitable for embedding within many programming environments.
