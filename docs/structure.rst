Program Structure
=================

A program consists of zero or more modules and a single script. A module is a
list of bindings. The script is the entry point of the program, and is a single
expression. Modules are stored in files with the ``.flm`` extension, and
scripts are stored in files with the ``.fls`` extension or no extension if they
are executable.
